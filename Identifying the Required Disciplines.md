In order to attract the right people to your event, we suggest a few simple guidelines:
* Define which disciplines should be represented at the workshop (be specific).
* Define a target number of participants for each discipline identified.
* Identify professional societies and other communities that have contact with these participants.
* Craft a few lines of unique messaging for each participant group that explains why they are needed at this type of event and what they might gain from participating.
