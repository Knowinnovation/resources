Assembling a collection of background readings (or viewings in the case of videos) is a very useful activity. The purpose of these documents is to help participants obtain a broader understanding of the problem space, and to fill in some of the gaps in their understanding. Although references can be solicited from anyone, we usually start with the mentor team, and the members of the steering committee, because these two groups will have a good overview of the problem area.

Given that the participants will represent a diverse range of disciplines, it is important to pitch the readings at the right level. Our general advice is to think about the readings one might recommend to members of a 1st year graduate course in your discipline. In other words, aim at intelligent people who are non-experts in your specific topic, but who understand how to read papers, and make their own connections. It is worth noting that some of the best examples of background reading have been youtube videos produced by media companies. This is particularly the case when dealing with complex social challenges, such as the opioid crisis. In this case, watching videos that helped to provide an overview of the problem, at a human level, can be very informative for some researchers who may be otherwise removed the ground-level issues.
