Welcome to the Community!

A MicroLab is a 60-90 minute, highly interactive virtual event. Unlike webinars which are focused on disseminating information, MicroLabs facilitate stimulating scientific discussions in smaller, more intimate virtual breakout groups.

We will use Zoom as the platform for the MicroLab. We strongly recommend that you download Zoom to your PC, laptop, or phone so you can participate fully. You can download the software [from this link](https://zoom.us/support/download)

If you are unable to install the Zoom platform on your computer, you can use Zoom on your smartphone or tablet.  It works very well on mobile devices. 

You will improve your experience and the sound quality for everyone else if you are able to find a quiet space with good broadband and, ideally, a comfortable headset.

You can test your Zoom software by visiting Zoom's test page https://zoom.us/test
