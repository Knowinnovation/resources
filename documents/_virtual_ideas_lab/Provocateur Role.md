Provocateurs can be stakeholders or experts in the field. They can tell success stories or describe catastrophes that should have been avoided. They should at the very least be compelling and skilled public speakers, with new data or unique points of view. Depending on the nature of the event, it can be useful to have a speaker that has little to do with the problem but offers the opportunity for Participants to draw analogies or to make connections that might stimulate their thinking. For instance, at an Ideas Lab on the subject of visualizing biological data, we invited a perfumer to address the group. It was a sideways break from the subject matter and inspired the Participants to think about another sense that we use to take in information and to generate new questions based on that experience. 

Provocateurs should be selected to offer a range of opinions about the challenge. It’s easy to be railroaded into featuring certain speakers for political reasons: try to avoid this. It’s also advisable to limit the number of provocateurs. If you have too many, count on a fatigue factor; the group will tune out and the input will be less useful.

Typically, Provocateurs are asked to prepare short presentations, about 20 minutes long. Then, there are 10 minutes for questions of clarification from the group. This is usually followed by 20 minutes of small group discussion, at tables, to react to the presentation. It's less important that Participants debate the merits of a Provocateur perspective; what matters more are their responses to the presentation and the questions that it brings up for them to consider moving forward.
