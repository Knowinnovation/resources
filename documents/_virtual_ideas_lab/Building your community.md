The single most important factor for the success of any event is ensuring that the right people are participating.  In the case of an innovation-oriented workshop, the right people are:
* Curious
* Open minded
* Collaborative
* From a wide range of disciplines

Finding people who meet the first three criteria is usually not too difficult, but reaching people who are not "the usual suspects" can be quite tricky. In order to attract the right people to your event, we suggest a few simple guidelines:

* Define which disciplines should be represented at the workshop, being specific can be helpful.
* Define a target number of participants for each discipline identified.
* Identify professional societies and other communities that have contact with these participants.
* Craft a few lines of unique messaging for each participant group that explains why they are needed at this type of event and what they might gain from participating.


Having built your disciplines list, the next step is to engage these communities. Much can be achieved through online methods - newsletters, targeted emails, and webinars. However, there is also great value in having discussions with people. For that reason, we recommend arranging a number of "on-ramp" presentations. We describe a basic approach to [On Ramp Presentations](On Ramp Presentations) here.
