We are now at the transition point in the ideas lab where the facilitators move into the background, and the mentors come to the fore. The participants have met each other, found out who is interested in what, and have started sketching out possible ideas.  Both the ideas, and the teams, are in a very early stage of development, so we can expect them to change significantly. This will include having teams dissolve, new teams/ideas appear, and existing teams merge/split in interesting ways. 

Over the next 3 sessions the participants will:
1. Review the PPC feedback they received from their initial presentations
1. Develop their ideas further
1. Identify the questions they want to explore with you at the mentor panel. The panel meetings will be a chance for each of the groups to meet with all the mentors, in one go, to pick your brains about any questions they have, and for you to give your thoughts about the overall idea.

For the next two sessions the mentors will continue to float between groups. Floating allows the mentors to engage in two key mentoring activities: Connecting, and Catalysing.
* Connecting involves both connecting people with people, e.g. pointing out that two groups might be discussing a question that has interesting overlaps, and connecting people with content, i.e. pointing out references, or even resources, that might be useful in the development of the projects.
* Catalysing is all about asking good questions that help the groups to strengthen their ideas. One could think of it as adopting a Socratic approach. You don’t need to provide answers, you simply need to understand the groups’ ideas and ask questions that will encourage them to think more deeply, and ambitiously.

It is important to remind participants, on a regular basis, of the core focus of the ideas lab. Having said that, given the nature of an ideas lab, we usually see ideas shooting off in many directions. What the mentors need to do is be clear with the participants when an idea falls outside the fundable ’space’. Often, particularly with intramural events, participants aren’t too worried if their ideas aren’t eligible for internal funding, because they are excited about their new idea, and will seek funding externally. However, it is important that everyone understands whether an idea is out of scope, just so no one is caught by surprise.

A pattern that we often see is where a group starts an idea with one focus, and then over time shifts to a different focus. In the course of making that transition they lose sight of what the mentors may have seen as the most exciting part of the original idea. As mentors you can’t force people to pursue a particular idea, but it can be really helpful to ask them why they moved away from a particular perspective, and also to explain why you found it interesting.

I realise that everyone’s calendars are very packed, but it might be useful for us to meet, either prior to the start of each of these sessions, or to stay online at the end.  If it would be possible to join  30 minutes earlier for our next session, we can align our general feedback. Failing that, we can continue this conversation via email.
