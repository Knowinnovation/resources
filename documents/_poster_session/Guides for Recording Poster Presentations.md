Hello,

The purpose of this email is to explain:
 * the design of the <<event>>, and how your poster session will work;
 * how you can record and upload your presentation;
 * what we need you to do in the short term.

The event has been designed so that each of the posters will be accompanied by a pre-recorded presentation. Your presentation will be, in essence, the talk you would give to anyone who stopped at your poster during a face to face event. The presentations will be made available to participants in advance of the event. This means that you can now use your time to focus on discussions with the participants. In order to prepare for the event, we need each poster presenter to complete the following steps: 

Key Steps:
 * Create your poster in the form of a series of slides. We  encourage the use of Google Slides, because it will make it very easy for participants to step through your presentation, prior to talking with you.
 * Use Zoom to record yourself talking the viewers through your slides. 
 * Finally, upload both the video, and the link to your Google Slides file to the dropbox file request link.

**Recording your presentation**

Although we encourage you to use Google Slides, and Zoom, we also recognize that you may want to use PowerPoint or Keynote. These two products offer a different, but equally good way of recording your voice as you move through your slides. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, e.g. “session title your name.mp4”
 * Upload the presentation to our server using this link:
