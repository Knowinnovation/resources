A good Call to Action presentation should leave participants with a clear understanding of the challenge, coupled with the desire to address it, and at least the beginnings of some thoughts on how they might participate. Obviously, this is a lot to ask from a single presentation. Fortunately, we have found that, as long as the challenge is important, covering the following points will usually get the desired result.
* What is the broad challenge we are addressing? It is probably best to approach this through the [5 Ws and an H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) technique. It won't be necessary to go into huge detail, but people do need to understand the broad definition of the problem. By the end of the Call to Action, participants should be able to give a short summary of your talk, and accurately convey the importance of the scientific challenge.
* What is the opportunity if we manage to solve the problem? Is it just the opposite of the problem (e.g. health rather than illness), or are their additional benefits? For example, would an increase in urban tree cover lead to a reduction in vandalism? 
* What is the risk if we don’t manage to solve the problem? This may already have been covered in the broad challenge, but is sometimes worth repeating.
* Why do we need new ideas? Are we stuck, or is it because we have new opportunities that we don’t know how to exploit?  If we are stuck, where are we stuck? People will find it helpful to understand where they might be able to help.
* What are the key points? If you had to condense the presentation into a single slide, what points would you want people to remember?
