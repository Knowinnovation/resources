This document explains:
 * the design of the event, and how your session will work;
 * how you can record and upload your Flash Talk presentation;
 * what we need you to do in the short term.

### What is a Flash Talk?

Flash Talks are designed to quickly engage the audience on a concept or idea and do so in a way that encourages follow up with the speakers. Part of the value of the Conference is the opportunity to network with colleagues and peers. We intend for these talks to facilitate productive and engaging conversations between the session presenters and the audience.

### Flash Talk Guidelines: 
5 minutes per presentation - All presenters will pre-record a five minute presentation referencing a single slide.
Please use your Flash Talk template to create your slide. 
During the KnowInnovation Presentation Briefing, our team will demonstrate how to record your presentation. 
Conference attendees will be able to watch your pre-recorded presentation, then ask you questions during live virtual Q&A sessions.

During the conference, each presenter will have an allocated Zoom breakout room in which you can discuss your talk with interested participants. Because your presentation will be made available to participants in advance of the event, you can now use your time to focus on discussions with, and between, the participants.  

How will the sessions work:
 * The recordings will be available on the website prior to the start of the event.
 * The participants will be able to browse all the presentations, and leave questions and comments via the viritual sticky notes.
 * At the appointed time(s), you will be invited to start a Zoom meeting. Participants will be able to join the Zoom meeting in order to talk with you. The participants will be able to jump between Zoom meetings, so that they can interact with as many presenters as possible.

**Recording your presentation**

We expect most presenters will want to record their slides with a voice over. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, session number and title, e.g. “123 session title your name.mp4”
 * Upload the presentation to our server using the link provided in the email:
