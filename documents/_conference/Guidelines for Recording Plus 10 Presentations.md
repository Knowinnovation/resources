Thank you for agreeing to be a speaker – or Provocateur as we call it – at the upcoming event.  We want to offer a few notes to help your structure your presentation. These notes are not meant to constrain your thinking; they are just a starting point.


- First, and foremost, the purpose of the presentation is to stimulate and provoke the participants' thinking, and ideally, get them to make new connections outside their normal domains. This means that you don't have to in any way “prove” your point, or win the audience over to a particular point of view. We simply need you to present ideas that might intrigue and provoke an active discussion among the participants.
-  Presentations are typically 7-10 minutes long, and most people create them by adding voice overs to a slide pack. There are details on how to record and upload your presentations below.
- You are welcome to structure your presentation in whatever way you feel will work best. However, in order to reduce the demands on your time, we often suggest that you think about a paper that you would give in 10 years time. The idea is that your presentation should highlight the big ideas, and questions, that your paper will explore, without needing to address every detail or obstacle. In essence we are inviting you to share some plausible day dreams.
 
**Recording your presentation**

Although you are welcome to record a ‘straight to smartphone camera’ presentation without slides, we expect most presenters will want to record their slides with a voice over. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, e.g. "session title your name.mp4"
 * Upload the presentation to our server using this link:
