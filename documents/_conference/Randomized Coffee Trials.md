A Randomized Coffee Trial (RCT) is a slightly tongue-in-cheek way of describing informal meetings between people, who don't usually get to spend time together. The idea originated at NESTA and has become popular around the world. The [original version of the RCT](http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/institutionalising-serendipity-productive-coffee-breaks) simply matched people, randomly, and invited them to meet, have coffee, and talk about whatever they found interesting.  Although this has proved to be very enjoyable, we have found that adding a little more structure to the event, can make the results even more useful.

Here is what we are inviting you to do:
1 We are going to pair you up with someone from a different discipline
1 You arrange a mutually convenient time to meet, typically for about 30 minutes
1 At the meeting we would like you to answer the question "If we had to do a research project together, what would be the most interesting question we could work on?". For the purposes of this activity, please don't feel constrained by resources or even the current state of scientific knowledge. We want to know what intriguing questions lie at the intersection of your disciplines, and experience.
1 Finally, we need you to tell us your top three questions.  We will send you a link to a website that will allow you to enter a brief summary of the questions. It is very simple, and all you need to do is to provide enough of a description so that everyone can get the essence of your question. 

Some Q&A for the curious
* Does it have to involve coffee?  No, there doesn't appear to be a strong relationship between caffeine and creativity, so other drinks are equally acceptable
* If I enjoy the experience, can I do another one? Yes, we would be delighted to arrange other RCT meetings
