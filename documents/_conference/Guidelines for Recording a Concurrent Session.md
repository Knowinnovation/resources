This document explains:
 * the design of the event, and how your session will work;
 * how you can record and upload your poster presentation;
 * what we need you to do in the short term.

The event has been designed so that all of the Concurrent Sessions will comprise a pre-recorded presentation, along with a Zoom breakout room in which you, and your colleagues, can discuss your sessions with interested participants. Your presentation will be made available to participants in advance of the event. This means that you can now use your time to focus on discussions with, and between, the participants.  

How will the sessions work:
 * The recordings will be available on the website prior to the start of the event.
 * The participants will be able to browse all the presentations, and leave questions and comments via the viritual sticky notes.
 * At the appointed time, your facilitator will start your Zoom meeting. Participants will be able to join the Zoom meeting and engage in Q&A with you.

**Recording your presentation**

We expect most presenters will want to record their slides with a voice over. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, session number and title, e.g. “123 session title your name.mp4”
 * Upload the presentation to our server using the link provided in the email:
