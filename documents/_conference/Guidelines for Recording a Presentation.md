**Recording your presentation**

We expect most presenters will want to record their slides with a voice over. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, session number and title, e.g. "123 session title your name.mp4"
 * Upload the presentation to our server using the link provided in the email:
