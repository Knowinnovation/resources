This document explains:
 * the design of the event, and how your session will work;
 * how you can record and upload your poster presentation;
 * what we need you to do in the short term.

### What is a Poster Presentation?

A virtual poster presentation will mirror the style of a typical poster at an in-person scientific conference.

Please make one slide that depicts your full poster as it would look if you were to present it in person. This slide may include standard sections such as an introduction, methods, results, conclusions, references, and acknowledgements.

Then, we would like you to create 4-5 slides that “zoom in” on the main sections of your poster. Please note that each of these slides can be copy and pasted from the sections of your full poster slide, with any necessary resizing. Here is a sample presentation for reference. This presentation was also included as a powerpoint in our email. 

### Poster Guidelines
 * Slides
   * Please use the slide template to create your poster. It is yours to edit, and is shared with our conference team. 
   * You must include the NCSE logo in your poster. We have added it in already for convenience.
   * You should include the logo of your school/affiliation. You may also want to include any funder logos if applicable.
   * You may add or delete  text boxes, images, graphs, and charts as needed. You can also change the size and shape of the template’s text boxes.
   * You may edit the font style and size, as well as the presentation colors.
   * Please do not alter the dimensions of the overall slide presentation.  

How will the poster sessions work:
 * The poster recordings will be available on the website prior to the start of the event.
 * The participants will be able to browse all the poster presentations, and leave questions and comments via the viritual sticky notes.
 * At the appointed time(s), you will be invited to start a Zoom meeting. Participants will be able to join the Zoom meeting in order to talk with you. The participants will be able to jump between Zoom meetings, so that they can interact with as many poster presenters as possible.

**Recording your presentation**

We expect most presenters will want to record their slides with a voice over. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, session number and title, e.g. “123 session title your name.mp4”
 * Upload the presentation to our server using the link provided in the email:
