Dear < name >,
<p>
Thank you for agreeing to be a Mentor at the upcoming < event title >. Here are a few guidelines that might help you assume the role:
<p>
 # What is a mentor? Mentors, also called subject guides, are analogous to “peer reviewers” but with a much more creative role - essentially a “critical friend” to the participants. You’ve been approached because you have knowledge about the subject area. We hope you’ll use that expertise to connect and catalyze the participants. This means connecting participants to each other, to the skills and expertise of others, and also to the wider body of knowledge. You’ll be able to encourage new ideas, highlight perspectives, and make links that seem exciting and novel.
 # By catalyze, we mean asking questions that will provoke or inspire the development of novel ideas. We find that asking provocative and open-ended questions is the best way to achieve this. By no means should you feel compelled to push your knowledge or try to win the participants over to a particular point of view. Rather, operating from your knowledge base, help the participants to discover pathways, questions, links, and solutions that they might not initially see.
 # At the start of the event, your generous listening and provocative questioning will help point the participants in productive directions. Toward the end of the event the mentor’s role changes: you’ll begin to adopt a more critical perspective in order to assist with the funding decisions.
 # You’ll work closely with the Director and the Facilitators (you can learn about their roles [http://hub.ki/groups/resources/wiki/RolesAndResponsibilities here]) to provide objective advice and input to the participants with the ultimate aim of ensuring that the workshop leads to high-quality, innovative, multidisciplinary research and excellent science.
