The following text was written by the Organisational Psychologist, Dr. Bharat Malde. It is offered as a guideline for how the reviewers should approach the task of appraising each potential participant.

SUMMARY: The 2-page Application should be used as the sole basis for review - without recourse to CVs, publication records, web search, candidate reputation or pre-knowledge. This simple ‘hand-bind’ will ensure a level playing field for all candidates and would also minimise bias - intended and unintended - contaminating the process. Departures from this simple rule should be kept to a minimum and undertaken only when considered as necessary and defensible.

The ideas lab is a unique setting when pitched against the conventional route to research and research funding. It is there to complement the mainstream, as something necessarily different, with the potential to sweep up candidates who may not be well-served by the conventional route. An invitation to reply to a small set of word-length limited event-specific questions in a short application form - as a common unit across the whole candidate field- should be regarded as the only fair and justifiable basis for assessing bids. Other recourse - to CVs, web search, publication records - should be guarded against even when seen as an acceptable and allowable part of normal practice. How much are CV and website contents genuine and believable? How does one allow for the variable presentation, size, length, style? How much are they an accurate reflection of the ‘unusual candidate’? Publication records too may provide misleading signals of worth: when journals still have a tendency to reward single rather than multi-specialisms, how would publications be a fair way to signify that something unusual, unrepresentative and unconventional that are often the special extras to look out for? While selection policy and practice varies across different organisers, this may be a good example to note: a leading UK Research Council adopted this as a must-do bind for its 2017 sandpit. The 2-page application replies were the only evidence allowed to be taken into account.

Conflict of Interest. Many agencies follow the CoI rule of panelists taking no part in the review of a candidates whom they may know personally or will have worked with. Where the Chair and the organisers deem it acceptable for a panel member to bring an important candidate pre-knowledge and perspective to the table, sensible departures may be justified, but only as an exception and where such straying from the norm can be deemed as fair and defensible. Such a departure may be allowable where the CoI reviewer’s input serves to confirm a generally positive candidate impression accorded by the rest of the Panel or where it serves to resolve a tie-breaker. Allowing a single panelist view to counter a poor application should be regarded as more problematic. Another basis for straying might be to redress a selection imbalance from under-representation. It is possible that a  minority applicant’s CV might offer useful counter-clues that their application form may fail to reflect. Where applicants are picked to plug a missing expertise by allowing for a poorer page 2, reviewers should be reminded of repeat evidence of what actually unfolds at the event. Such discipline-only applicants do not always fire well at the event.
