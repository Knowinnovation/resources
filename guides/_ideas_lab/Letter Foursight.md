Hello
We are looking forward to meeting you tomorrow at the <<event name>> event, and as you know one of the things we will be doing is talking about problem solving styles, and how they can affect team collaboration.
In order to help everyone understand their own preferences we have found it helpful to use an instrument called FourSight. FourSight is a multi-question survey that shows where your preferences lie in the innovation process. We have used it in all our previous workshops, and the participants have found it to be really interesting.
If you would like to take FourSight online, please click the link below. It takes about 15 minutes to complete. 
However, just before your finger clicks the mouse button... People sometimes have concerns about psychometric instruments. They worry that the results might somehow be used to judge them. So, I would like to put those worries to rest:
- Foursight doesn't say anything about the quality of your problem solving, it only looks at your style. It is the psychological equivalent of whether you are right or left handed. So, the results are neither good, nor bad.
- The assessment is confidential. Your results are intended only for your own use, and we do not share them. However, people are usually very happy to share their results, because they provide an interesting insight into how they, and their colleagues, work together.
- Completing the instrument is entirely voluntary. Choosing not to complete it won't limit your ability to participate in anyway.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the instrument, please email me <<contact email>>

Please read the directions, answer all the questions and submit the form. Try to submit your responses within one hour of beginning the assessment or your results may be timed out, and you will have to begin again. Once you press the "submit results" button, your job is done. Your answers will automatically go to a secure database and your results will be given to you at our upcoming session.
 
Please complete the FourSight profile as soon as possible !
