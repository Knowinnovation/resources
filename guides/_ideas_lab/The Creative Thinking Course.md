Our workshops are based on a deliberate creative thinking process. We have found it useful to give participants a brief introduction to the process, before they attend a workshop. In order to make this introduction as simple as possible, we created a small online course. The course comprises a series of short videos (5 mins each), that cover two main topics:
* The basics of creative behaviour, i.e. what actions help people to both develop new ideas, and help others to do the same?
* An introduction to the Creative Problem Solving process.
In preparation for the workshop, we encourage you to spend a few minutes watching some of the videos. At a minimum, we recommend watching the first five videos, which cover the core behaviours. If you find the topic interesting, then please continue through the rest of the course.
