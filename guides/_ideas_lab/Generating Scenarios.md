Scenarios are a great way of exploring, and communicating intriguing possibilities. The provide a plausible world in which you, and your colleagues, can explore "what if" questions, and develop new ideas.

In order to explore a wide enough range of ideas, we need you to generate a series of alternative futures. You could think of these as plot outlines. These outlines define Who, Where, and What, but they don't address How. Answering the How question becomes the task of the writing groups.

The Who question is broadly defined by the scenario matrix, but we would like you to think about this at a much more detailed level. Can you name the actors involved in the scenario, or at least define their roles? Likewise, for the Where question. Can you set your scenario in a specific location, even if that location is imaginary, i.e. a river bed outside a small village in western Afghanistan. Finally, the What question needs to define an interesting challenge. The scenario is set 10 years in the future, and written in the present tense. What is the problem that people are trying to solve, or the opportunity they are trying to exploit. 

A good scenario is brief, easy to understand, and provokes interesting ideas. It doesn't need to cover every detail, and it certainly doesn't need to be perfect. The purpose of the scenario is to provide a loose framework in which people can explore interesting ideas, and create a How response that helps us all to see the future in a different way.
