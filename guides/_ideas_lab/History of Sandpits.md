# The Sandpit#

## What is it? ##
A Sandpit is an intensive, interactive workshop designed to produce radically innovative research project proposals. Participants, from a diverse range of disciplines, come together in a creative, free-thinking environment – away from their everyday routines and responsibilities – and immerse themselves in a collaborative process around an important problem or challenge.

The Sandpit was conceived in 2003, by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), with the objective of inspiring innovative and inter-disciplinary research proposals. Knowinnovation helped with the early design, and we’ve been privileged to be involved with these workshops ever since.

The event is usually a 5-day residential program, with 20 to 30 participants invited from different disciplines and organizations. Over the course of the week, the group works to deepen their shared understanding of the designated challenge, to redefine the problems within the challenge and to generate novel ideas for research proposals.

The typical criteria used to measure the output of a Sandpit event: Is it risky and cutting edge research? Is it exciting science? Would it be unlikely to get funded through another source? Does it require at least two disciplines?

A Sandpit is not a typical meeting. Nobody stands up to give their papers. There’s no poster session. It’s never about a challenge within one domain; a Sandpit is necessarily interdisciplinary. It’s not a workshop designed to produce incremental research advancement; the goal is to provoke out of the ordinary science that wouldn’t otherwise be funded.

If a Sandpit is organized by a national funding body, there are usually research funds associated with it. However, this is not an absolute requirement. As more institutions start to run their own internal events, the nature of the labs is changing. Internal events can be designed to generate novel, exciting, pre-proposals which can then be submitted to funding bodies.

## Types of Sandpits ##
When Knowinnovation first started facilitating Sandpits and Ideas Lab (as they are known in the US), we identified two types of events that result in the production of novel and risky research proposals:

### Open-Ended Sandpit ###
This workshop is designed to address a general question, and leaves room for a broad range of responses to the question. For instance Enhancing Photosynthesis or Using Maths to Understand the Evolutionary Process were two open-ended Sandpits. The organizers put forward an important and yet general question and participants were invited to come up with ideas.

### Stakeholder-Driven Sandpit ###
This type of Sandpit is more directed. The funder will have a very specific user-driven question that needs to be addressed. There’s more stakeholder input, and more guidance throughout the process to make sure the groups are coming up with ideas that will be aligned with the needs of the stakeholder. For example, EPSRC, in tandem with P&G, hosted a Sandpit on the topic of more effective Cold Water Washing. They had very specific question with outcomes in mind, and were much more engaged in the development of the research ideas toward a specific end.

As different agencies have experimented with the Sandpit methodology, another form of Sandpit has emerged, one that uses our process to address social or organizational issues.

### Change-Oriented Sandpit ###
This Lab might very well result in research to address a central question (for example, the NSF held three consecutive Sandpits to address social inequality in geo, engineering and bio science education) but could also produce new initiatives and special programs to leverage or promote a desired change in a discipline or a community. While it is always important to be sure that the right kinds of participants are assembled for a Sandpit, in this case it is extremely important to recruit the right people in the room to effect a change, not simply to agree that something must be done.

## Classifying your Sandpit ##
Sandpits promote the development of innovative research proposals that address difficult, messy problems. Depending upon the history of the problem, the research community might have very different perspectives. For example, an event that focused on the educational opportunities for brain/computer interfaces, would probably be drawing upon a relatively clean canvas. But an Ideas lab looking for new approaches to broadening participation in STEM education, would have a wealth of existing work which may inform the design of the event. Understanding, broadly, the community’s position is essential in planning and executing a successful Sandpit.

We ask three questions at the start of the planning process:
1 Has the community developed a number of interesting, provocative ways of framing the problem?
1 Does anyone, anywhere have ideas that are good enough to really solve this problem, and/or exploit the opportunities?
1 If so, what is stopping us from solving it?
Obviously, the answers to these questions are subjective and based on the organizers’ understanding of the area. But because program officers and faculty members are usually deeply involved with the community, their insights can be accurate and illuminating.

### The Jumpstart ###
Participants often go back to their institutions after a Sandpit and reflect on how the process can lead to a deeper understanding of a challenge and/or novel ideas to address it. But usually they don’t have the budget to do a full Sandpit, or it’s hard to pull too many of their internal staff away for five days. Knowinnovation offers a 3-day mini-Sandpit, called a Jumpstart.

It is literally that – a Jumpstart to enable the right people to come together and start the creative process. If a Sandpit or a Sandpit is a marathon, the Jumpstart is a sprint, the 100-meter dash that allows people to get their creative juices flowing, which hopefully results – down the road – in novel solutions.

Jumpstarts follow the same process as a Sandpit, except they run for a shorter time and participants don’t get as far in their thinking. They’ll generate potential ideas at the event, but the process of developing ideas into possible research projects must continue after the event, with groups working together on their own time to refine and add substance to their proposals.

When time and resources are limited, the shorter program can certainly ignite new thinking and spur conversations that wouldn’t otherwise occur in typical day-to-day interaction. It’s a smaller spark for innovation, but a vibrant spark nonetheless. Sandpits and Jumpstarts are different in depth and detail, but in many ways the same steps must be taken to prepare for the event and to facilitate it. The guidelines laid out in this book can be used to prepare for a Sandpit or for a Jumpstart.

## Who Cares? ##
We’ve also recognized that the presence, or absence, of stakeholders can impact in the design of a Sandpit. For this reason, we sometimes use a fourth question: who cares?

If the problem is of great importance to the community but of little direct application to the wider world (in the foreseeable future), then inviting a diverse range of community members is a perfectly valid strategy. However, if there are stakeholders pushing for an answer, then the challenge becomes one of how to incorporate their input without allowing their points of view to frame the problem too early.

## Outcomes ##
A typical Sandpit usually produces between 5 and 10 research proposals that the event organizers can choose to fund, or not, depending on the merit and intrigue of the proposals.

The difference between proposals from a Sandpit and those from a regular call for proposals, aside from being inherently multi-disciplinary, is the level of risk. Sandpits proposals are meant to be wilder and more imaginative. The participants often agree that they would never have come up with this idea on their own; it’s the mix of people and expertise that leads to the novel and riskier output. They also agree that these are pro- posals that would not be funded under other circumstances.

Getting to innovative research proposals is the primary objective, but there are other benefits to hosting and attending a Sandpit event. The intense exposure to the thinking of other accomplished scientists in a “seek to understand” environment is a great learning opportunity. Participants tend to broaden their thinking after working with people from different disciplines who use different terminology and framework. The professional friendships that develop at a Sandpit can also change the way participants work and network. Sandpits build interdisciplinary networks around challenges. Although a Sandpit involves very little “training” in creative thinking, the participants will nonetheless learn new tools and techniques for thinking creatively by participating in the Sandpit process.

### Using Creative Problem Solving ###
The Creative Problem Solving (CPS) process (on which Sandpits are based) has four broad stages:

# **Clarification:** gathering data, formulating problem statements
# **Ideation:** generating possibilities
# **Development:** refining ideas into workable solutions
# **Action:** creating project plans, and identifying obstacles

Any Sandpit will span all four stages, but there can be a significant difference in emphasis, which manifests itself in terms of where time is spent. For example, in 2009 we ran a Sandpit on Synthetic Biology. At the time, the field was relatively young, and even the definition of what’s involved in Synthetic Biology was still open for discussion. Not surprisingly, a significant amount of time was spent on understanding the problems that various researchers were exploring, and discussing possible ideas. Action plans were created, but they were not what some might consider highly detailed.

Contrast that Sandpit with some recent events we have run on increasing diversity within higher education. The problem itself is far from solved. However, due to significant amounts of work in the area, there is a shared understanding of what the problems look like, and there are already some ideas that have been successfully implemented. In cases like these, the Sandpit becomes much more focused on understanding the under- lying barriers to successful implementation. Of course, once those barriers are surfaced, it is not unusual to find oneself back at the clarification stage, and looking for new ideas to overcome the barriers. But the point is that understanding the starting point of an event is critically important. This has an impact on the type of people you might invite, the design of the event, the amount of any funding that might be on offer, and even the definition of success.
