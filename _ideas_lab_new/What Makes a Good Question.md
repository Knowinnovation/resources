A good question:
* is specific enough in scope that it doesn’t appear vast and impossible to solve;
* requires input from up to 5 identifiable areas of key expertise;
* has a defined topic area on which experts haven’t collaborated much.

### Examples
* **Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges of Wearable and / or Ambient Sensors (2016)**: The objective is to generate creative strategies for addressing challenges associated with the visualization, modeling, and analysis of biomedical big data coming from wearable or ambient sensors. Such challenges arise from multifaceted data structures like networks and images, sparse or missing data, streaming of non-stationary time series data, the need for integration from multiple sources of data, interaction effects, etc. 
* **Food, Energy, and Water Systems (FEWS) (2016)**: The objective of the conference is to identify priorities for interdisciplinary research that will help to enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of regions where existing FEW system infrastructures and resources may experience significant pressures due to such migrations coupled with the direct effects of increasing temperature and climate variability. 
* **Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges (2015)**: The goal is to foster the formation of new interdisciplinary collaborations among mathematicians, statisticians and biomedical science researchers on developing models, methods and approaches for overcoming challenges in precision medicine.
* **Smart and Connected Communities for Learning (2016)**: A successful smart and connected community for learning would demonstrate marked improvement in (a) participants’ awareness of opportunities in their locale for learning, (b) their ability to engage in and sustain related learning experiences in particular settings and across multiple places, and (c) their experience of their community as interconnected in support of learning.
