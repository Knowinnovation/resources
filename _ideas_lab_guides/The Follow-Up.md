== Feedback & Evaluation ==

Knowinnovation workshops are expensive to run and to fund, and are often paid for using taxpayers’ money. For these reasons it is important to have a robust evaluation process. At the same time, the evaluation process needs to be efficient so that people see it as beneficial rather than a burden.

The event should be evaluated by every player. 

'''Participants:'''

Time permitting, it’s helpful to do an evaluation of the benefits, potentials, and concerns (including possible ways to overcome those concerns) using Post-its, as Participants leave the event and the experience is fresh in their minds, followed by a survey (Google docs or similar) to evaluate the venue, administration, process, and outcomes of the workshop.

'''Mentors:'''

In many ways, the Mentors are engaged in a continuous process of feedback and evaluation. Part of their role is to provide input, and therefore their post-event feedback shouldn’t provide any surprises. Their primary feedback will focus on the merit of the ideas.

'''Facilitators:'''

Usually it will be the facilitators who are running the feedback sessions, but it is also worth collecting their input about how the event ran compared to others, and about the venue and how it supported the workshop.

'''The Output:'''

Answering the question “Was it worth it?” is tricky, but essential. Obviously, each event is unique, and organizing a comparative study is very difficult. But once the proposals have been reviewed and evaluated, it is important to ask whether or not this event was worth the time, energy, and funding allocated to it, and whether a workshop like this might be useful in the future.
