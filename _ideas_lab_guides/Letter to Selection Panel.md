Dear Colleagues,
<p>
Thank you for agreeing to be a reviewer for < event title >. Selecting the participants for this event is integral to the event's success. The application deadline is < date >. Shortly thereafter, you will be forwarded applications to review. Following the review period, the selection meeting will take place on < date >.  
<p>
You will score the applicants based their answers to the [SampleApplicationForm six key questions found here]. Using the following rubric, you will be asked to rate applicants for a blend of an innovative, transdisciplinary mindset; intellectual curiosity and flexibility; and the ability to play as equal, collegial, enthusiastic team-players.
<p>
 * '''4 HIGHLY PROMISING''' – has all of : a) an innovative bent, b) theme-relevant expertise and c) positive personal attributes; should bring special value
 * '''3 PROMISING''' – is strong on two of the three areas with an allowable weakness in the third; good promise overall if a little lackluster in some areas
 * '''2 MIXED VALUE''' – a mixed profile but not without the odd sign of promise
 * '''1 UNSUITED''' – a thin or an uncompelling application, or too packed or dense, or self- promoting, showcasing or pre-agenda their primary motive, or too set in their thinking, or they come with a solution, or better suited to the conventional individual-bid route, or may be better suited in a time-limited role (for example, provocateur, stakeholder, or virtual poster slot).

'''Determining the Final Selections:'''
The final participant list needs to comprise people who are enthusiastic about the possibility of interdisciplinary collaboration around the driving topic. Furthermore, these events require a good mixture of disciplines, career length (especially early-careers), gender, cultural background, and life experience, because this enriches the innovative quality, outputs, and outcomes of a Knowinnovation workshop. The purpose of this type of event is to create projects that will surprise and intrigue. Involving a wide range of people in the conversations is the most important element in achieving this outcome.
<p>
The ideal KI workshop participants are those who come with no pre-agenda other than the excitement around the subject of the workshop. They are able to work together as equals without being precious about themselves, their own ideas, or their expertise. They enjoy starting with a clean slate or playing around with draft ideas that they delight in seeing developed in a collaborative setting into vastly enhanced and exciting, novel breakthroughs.

When thinking about your overall selections, please bear in mind that a diverse mix of the right kind of participants is important to boost the innovation richness and dynamic: ensure that the invited group is a good mix across early to senior careers*, gender, culture, type of institute, and life experience. More on diversity can be found [http://hub.ki/groups/resources/wiki/SelectingParticipants here].

*''When picking senior academics or specialists, please be on guard to pick those who are able to play as equals with the rest rather than come with an imposing eminence that can easily disenfranchise other participants. In this respect, early-careers, if picked well, come with the advantage of being free of any burden to have to protect reputation, name, and fame, the latter occupying the wrong end of Ideas Workshop suitability.''
<p>
Thank you for your participation.
