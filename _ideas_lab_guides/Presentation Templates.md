Once working groups have formed, we send them off to work in break-out rooms to develop their ideas into projects. We ask them to come back every few hours and present their thinking to the full group and to get feedback. These instructions are - more or less, with customization depending on the challenge and the funder - what we give them to guide their presentations.

**Presentation 1: Day 3**
 * Working title
 * Summary of the problem
 *  Whoâ€™s in your group?
 * What's novel?
 * Gaps to fill, resources you need
 * 5 minutes max

**Presentation 2: Day 4 AM**
 * Working title
 * Summary of the problem (extremely brief, just for context)
 * New thinking since last presentation
 * How you've incorporated feedback
 * What's novel about your idea?
 * What do you want to achieve and how will this make a difference? What's the potential impact?
 * Group members, their roles, and why this team?
 * What skills/expertise are you missing/seeking?
 * 7 minutes max

**Presentation 3: Day 4 PM**
 * Working title
 * Summary
  * of the problem (brief, just for context)
  * of the idea (brief, just to be comprehensive)
 *  Enhancements since your last presentation
 * How you've ''maximized'' novelty - what's the __wow__?
 * How you've incorporated feedback
 * Any knowledge, skills, input still needed
 * Rough cost ''estimates''
 * Again, who's in your group, and why? What's the contribution of each member?
 * 5 minutes max

**Final Presentation: Day 5**
 * Proposal title
 * Summary
  * of the problem and the idea
  * of what you hope to achieve and how
 * How is it transformative?
 * How you've maximized novelty
 * What's the __wow__ factor?
 * Final tally of who's in your group and their specific roles
 * What is the potential impact of the project?
 * Cost with more detail (than yesterday)
 * 10 minutes max
