Suitability for an Ideas Workshop rests on both the science and the person behind the science being right: the ‘right’ individual is as important – often more so – as the ‘right’ science. The ideal Ideas Workshop participants are those who come with no pre-agenda other than the excitement of an ideas-play around the subject of the event, playing as equals without being precious about themselves, their own ideas, or expertise. They enjoy starting with a clean slate, exploring draft ideas that they delight in seeing developed into vastly enhanced and exciting, novel breakthroughs, all achieved in the cut and thrust of a collaborative setting.

In order to reach a decision about any particular applicant, please assess the replies to the [SampleApplicationForm six key questions in the application], and then ask yourself:
Looking at the replies in the round, to what extent do I think this applicant has the expertise, interests and approach to bring special value to the this event? Do they have the right blend of an innovative, trans-disciplinary mindset and an intellectual curiosity & flexibility? Do they have the positive outlook and the ability to play as equal, collegial, enthusiastic team-players? Or do they look more suited to the conventional individual-application route?
Once you have reached a conclusion about an applicant, please score as follows (as an example):
* **4 HIGHLY PROMISING** – has all of : a) an innovative bent, b) theme-relevant expertise and c) positive personal attributes; should bring special value
* **3 PROMISING** – is strong on two of the three areas with an allowable weakness in the third; good promise overall if a little lackluster in some areas
* **2 MIXED VALUE** – a mixed profile but not without the odd sign of promise
* **1 UNSUITED** – a thin or an uncompelling application, or too packed or dense, or self- promoting, showcasing or pre-agenda their primary motive, or too set in their thinking, or they come with a solution, or better suited to the conventional individual-bid route, or may be better suited in a time-limited role (for example, provocateur, stakeholder, or virtual poster slot).

Finally, when thinking about your overall selections, please bear in mind that a diverse mix of the right kind of participants is important to boost the innovation richness and dynamic: ensure that the invited group is a good mix across early to senior careers*, gender, culture, type of institute, and life experience.
**Six Questions**:
1 Summary of professional background
1 What expertise do you bring to meet the transdisciplinary challenges associated with this challenge?
1 What is your approach to working in teams?
1 How would you describe your ability to engage and work with non-experts?
1 How do you see yourself suited to this type of workshop?
1 What would you gain from participating in this type of workshop?

**Determining the Final Selections:**
The final participant list needs to comprise people who are enthusiastic about the possibility of interdisciplinary collaboration around the driving topic. Furthermore, you will require a good mixture of disciplines, career length (especially early-careers), gender, cultural background, and life experience, because this enriches the innovative quality, outputs, and outcomes of an Ideas Workshop. The purpose of this type of event is to create projects that will surprise and intrigue. Involving a wide range of people in the conversations is the most important element in achieving this outcome.

When picking senior academics or specialists, please be on guard to pick those who are able to play as equals with the rest rather than come with an imposing eminence that can easily disenfranchise other participants. In this respect, early-careers, if picked well, come with the advantage of being free of any burden to have to protect reputation, name, and fame, the latter occupying the wrong end of Ideas Workshop suitability.''

Thank you for your participation.
