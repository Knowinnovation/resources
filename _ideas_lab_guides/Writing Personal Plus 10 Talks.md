title: Writing Personal Plus 10 Talks
includeIn: participants
---
One of the most important aspects of our meeting will be encouraging everyone to think ambitiously, and to explore intriguing possibilities.  In order to help people enter this frame of mind, we are asking everyone to prepare a 5 minute talk which addresses two questions:
 * What would be the most interesting research project that you would like to be doing, 10 years from now?
 * How might that project relate to the core topic(s) of the meeting?
We invite you to make assumptions about what will be available, 10 years hence, and to highlight the challenges which will still be major obstacles.

Please note, we are going to ask you to discuss your ideas in small table groups, so there is no need to prepare any slides. It is an entirely informal way to sharing your vision of the future, and helping others to make new connections. Also, given that we are asking you to take a leap into the future, no one can prove you wrong for at least 10 years, so don't feel too constrained by reality!"
