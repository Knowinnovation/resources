Thank you for agreeing to be a Mentor at the upcoming workshop! Mentors are similar to “peer reviewers” but with a much more creative role: to connect and catalyze. The Mentor team is usually a diverse group, providing expertise on various dimensions of the problem. Although each event is different, the Mentor role usually includes:
 * Encouraging new ideas by asking questions.
 * highlighting ideas that seem exciting. 
 * Making connections between participants and to the wider body of knowledge.
 * Assisting in funding recommendations.

These pages are designed to introduce you to the process and highlight the specific aspects of your role.
