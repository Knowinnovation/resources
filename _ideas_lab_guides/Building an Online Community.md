=== Collaboration Tools ===
Over the last few years, we have found that many events can benefit from some form of collaborative technology. That are lots of systems to choose from:  [https://www.google.com/docs/about/ Google Docs] provides a great way for everyone to contribute to the development of initial ideas, and planning tools, such as [https://trello.com/ Trello], can really help teams to develop action plans.

However, these tools tend to focus on specific stages of an event. Our experience has shown that it is also very useful to have an online location where everyone has access to information about the upcoming event, as well as easy ways to stay connected to the community once the event has completed. This is particularly important when an event has attracted participants from multiple institutions, and even different countries. For this reason, we often create dedicated groups on our [http://hubzero.org HubZero] system.

[http://hubzero.org HubZero] was developed as a platform to support scientific collaboration. It is used to support research in many disciplines, and provides a wide range of collaborative tools. A private group on the system provides participants with a secure, facilitated, space in which they can:
 * Meet other participants;
 * Share and review background briefing documents;
 * Collaboratively develop project ideas;
 * Engage in online discussions, before, during and after the workshop.

We run two main types of collaboration sites: 
 * Mini-sites which are closed groups running within our main site; and 
 * Dedicated sites which run on their own servers.
The mini-sites are appropriate for most meetings. They provide a full set of collaboration tools for the participants, as well as technical and facilitation support from a designated Community Manager. You can see a list of some of our mini-sites [https://hub.ki/groups/browse here]. Dedicated sites, such as [https://nexss.info NExSS], which we run for NASA's Exoplanet community, are appropriate if the community is likely to grow, and holds a range of separate meetings, over an extended period of time.
