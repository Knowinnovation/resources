title: Letter to Plus 10 Speakers
layout: default
---
Plus Talks are a specific type of provocation. We invite people to come and give the 5-10 minute version of the papers that they are going to give in 10 years' time. The intention is to let them think far enough into the future so that they aren't constrained by immediate reality, but close enough so that it isn't pure science fiction. The purpose of the presentation is to let the audience identify the challenges that would have to be overcome, and the possible ways in which that might be done.''

Dear < name >,


Thank you for agreeing to be a speaker – or Provocateur as we call it – at the upcoming < workshop title > in < location > on < date >. We want to offer a few notes and guidelines to help your structure your presentation. These notes are not meant to constrain your thinking; they are just a starting point.


# First, and foremost, the purpose of the presentation is to stimulate and provoke the participants' thinking, and ideally, get them to make new connections outside their normal domains. This means that you don't have to in any way “prove” your point, or win the audience over to a particular point of view. We simply need you to present ideas that might intrigue and provoke an active discussion among the participants.
# Presentations are typically 7-10 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes for questions of clarification, but no more than that. We aren't interested in people debating the merits of a particular perspective; we are actually more interested in their reaction to your presentation and to think more about what you’ve shared. 


If you have any questions then please do not hesitate to contact us by email at < contact email address >. 


Sincerely,


< name >
