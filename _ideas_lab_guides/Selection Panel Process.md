### The Selection Process 

#### Before the Panel 
* Once the deadline has passed - taking into account the local submitter time - all applications will be placed in the shared file system designated for this event, we recommend Google Drive. In addition, the file folder will contain the [ScoringGuidanceforSelectionPanelMembers Selection Panel guidelines] and a spreadsheet which will detail the applications in terms of the applicant's name, institution, department, top level research expertise, etc. There will also be a column titled "Initial Panel Decision" -which will be subdivided, one column for each Panel member. The final column will be titled "FINAL Panel Selection Decision" and will record the final decision that is made collectively at the Panel, which will be a Yes selected to attend the workshop, a No not selected to attend the workshop, or Alternate back-up in case invited Participants cannot attend. The spreadsheet will also contain a column titled ‘Conflict of Interest’ CoI that will be blank. As the Panelists are reading through the applications they can record into this column their name in the relevant cell relating to the applicant with whom they have a conflict.
* Any applications that are invalid - for whatever reason - will be removed from the folder and the spreadsheet.
* The Panel members will be asked to read through the applications, excluding the ones with which they have conflicts, prior to the Panel meeting. They will be asked to fill in any conflicts, as noted above, and also to record their initial thoughts in the relevant Initial Panel Decision column on whether the applicant, on reading their !EoI, should be a Yes they should be selected to attend the workshop; strong !EoI, a Maybe they could be selected to attend the workshop but there are a few concerns, or maybe their application isn’t as strong as others with the same or similar research expertise or a No - they should not be selected to attend the workshop; weak application.
* The Panelists will email their spreadsheets to the appointed contact person by the agreed deadline. The contact person will then collate the spreadsheets into one master spreadsheet.
* The master spreadsheet will show those applications on which there is unanimity, e.g. all Panelists agreed 'Yes' or all agreed 'No'.

#### At the panel
**The Selection Panel process:**
* Welcome and introductions.
* Review of the guidelines.
* Review the process, including the method for handling any CoIs.
* ***First Pass of the applications***
  * A statement from the Chair that there are X number of applications that are over length and that have therefore been rejected. We can display these on the spreadsheet.
  * A quick look at those applications which have been recorded as No by either all the Panelists or by the majority of the Panelists. If all are happy and in agreement with this, then these will be rejected. If need be the Panel can go back and discuss some of these applications in greater depth if there is a mix of views. Those applications will either stay as No or will move to Maybe.
  * Panel members then turn their attention to the group of applications that are in the Maybes. These applications will probably have the most mixed views from the Panel. The Panel should go through each application - one Panelist to open the discussion initially; Panelists can take it in turns to open the discussions for each application, guided by the Chair. The Panelist should state the applicant's name, institution, and background expertise (top level), followed by what the Panelist thinks the applicant could bring to the workshop, how well the applicant might fit in, and a summary of whether the Panelist thinks the applicant is a Yes or a No. Then the Chair should open it up to the rest of the group for discussion - including the views of Knowinnovation's consulting Organizational Psychologist, Bharat Maldé. A decision is collectively made and recorded on the spreadsheet. This decision is a first pass decision; the Panel will revisit the entire spreadsheet again on a second pass to double check that everyone is happy with the decisions. This process continues for each application, so the Panel should aim to spend no more than a couple of minutes on each application. Some decisions will be agreed upon quickly, others will of course take a little longer. If the group of Panelists are agonizing over their decision on an applicant for 5 minutes, then that generally means that the !EoI is not grabbing their attention. If the Panelists are not getting excited about having that applicant as a Participant at the workshop, then that applicant is probably a No.
  * This process allows for the applications in the Maybe list to be sorted into either the Yes group or the No group.
  * The Selection Panel next focuses on the Yes group and repeats the process. Is everyone happy that all those applicants in the Yes group are in the correct group? It may be that the Yes group contains 50 applications, which is of course too many to invite to the workshop. However, at the first pass the only concern is, “Are those applicants in the Yes group the people whom the Panelists would like to see at the workshop - the correct attributes, skills, and research expertise?”
* ***Second Pass of the applications***
  * Once the first pass has been completed, the Panel revisits the entire list. They begin by asking the question: “Are we happy that there is no applicant in the No group that we would want to place into the Yes group?” If everyone are happy, then the No group is rejected.
  * The group then closely examines the set of applicants in the Yes group. Does the group have the right number of applicants, with a good mix of disciplines, gender balance, and Institutional balance, and also a good mix of people with diverse research backgrounds? The Panelists refine the Yes group until they are happy with the final selection.
  * At this point they can also select a number of Alternates 
* ***FINAL Panel Selection Decision***
Throughout the selection of the applicants, the Selection Panel must consider:
 * the diverse research expertise that must be present at the workshop
 * a gender balance (as far as possible)
 * a cultural balance
 * a good balance of institutional representation (i.e. no bias to any one particular Institution)
All of these factors must be taken that into account when allocating decisions.
#### After the panel 
1. An email will be sent to the applicants that have been selected to attend the workshop informing them of this decision, asking them to confirm their attendance, and letting them know what the next steps are (e.g. sharing any dietary requirements, flight bookings, location of the venue details, dress code, things they might need to bring with them, etc.)
1. An email will also be sent to those applicants that were not successful informing them of this decision.
