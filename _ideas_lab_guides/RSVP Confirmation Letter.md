Here is another option: 

Dear xxx,

We are very much looking forward to working with you next week at the XXXX event/sandpit.

There is no ‘pre-work’ as such, but we just wanted to give you an idea of what to expect, so that you can get as much as possible from the time we have together. It is really important to remember that this is YOUR event, and as the facilitators, we are there to take responsibility for the process so you can fully concentrate on the content of the discussions and exploring interesting perspectives, challenges, and ideas. All we ask of you is that you come ready to share your knowledge and expertise, but also to be curious about other peoples’ points of view, to ask questions and to be ready to push your thinking into potentially new and different areas.

We are confident that if, as a group, we can create a working environment where people feel comfortable to share, question, learn and develop ideas, we can really stretch our thoughts into new and potentially productive areas.

Thank you in advance for giving your time, and we look forward to seeing you at xx: xx on xxth MMM.

Kind regards,
< organizing team >
