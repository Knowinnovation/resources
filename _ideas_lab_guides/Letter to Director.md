Dear < name >,
<p>
Thank you for agreeing to be the Director for the upcoming < workshop title >. Here are a few important points of information concerning your role: 
<p>
1. Your participation in the planning calls and preparatory meetings will help guide the facilitation team to design an agenda pertinent to the challenge at hand, and will also help you to understand better the process they will be using during the event.
1. Reviewing the participant applications and helping to decide which applications to select during the “sift meeting” is also extremely important. You should have a good sense about who the participants are and where they come from prior to the event.
1. As Director, we’ll ask you to kick off the workshop with a [brief presentation](Guidance for the Call to Action Presenters) that describes the challenge that is central to this workshop, what has brought us here, why it’s complex or yet unsolved, and why is it important that we address it. It’s true that many of the participants will have a good idea about this, having applied to come, but starting everyone off on the same page will create a common point of departure for the rest of the event. During the course of the event, you may wish to repeat this, as participants may get distracted by interesting questions and conversations that lead to exciting science, but not the kind of science the funders are hoping to cultivate.
<p>
We truly appreciate your willingness to take on this role at the upcoming workshop. For more information on the other roles within this workshop, please see [RolesAndResponsibilities this Roles and Responsibilities document]. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at < contact email address >.

Sincerely,
<br>
