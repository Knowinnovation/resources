These recommendations are offered on the basis of our extensive experience in running innovation workshops. However, the specific requirements for each event will be defined in conjunction with your event‚Äùs project manager, so please treat these recommendations as broad guidelines. For a visual example of an ideal room layout, please see [[File(Ideal_Room_Layout.pdf)]].
### Meeting Rooms
 * A large main meeting room space with plenty of room to move around. A good rule of thumb: it should be twice the size necessary to seat everyone at small round tables. For instance, you need 1800-2200 ft^2^ (170-205 m^2^) for a workshop of 25-30 participants.
 * Carpeting on the floor to absorb sound
 * Round tables that seat 6 people in crescent round format (no long boardroom tables, please!)
 * Comfortable chairs
 * Chairs and tables that can be moved around in the room - they cannot be fixed to the floor
 * Windows for natural light
 * A **lot** of empty wall space (painted walls that can hold painters tape; fabric walls that can hold fabric pins) where flip-chart sheets may be posted side by side. This is important: we need to see the information recorded from each step of the workshop. 
 * Permission to use hallways and common space for hanging materials on the wall, if necessary
 * Break-out rooms or informal meeting spaces for small group conversations that seat 5 to 8 people
 * A dedicated room for mentors to meet
 * Fast !WiFi - everywhere (this is essential!)
 * Power strips for recharging
### A/V Facilities 
 * At least 1 LCD projector
 * A good sound system that will connect with a computer or an iPad
 * Two wireless microphones
 * 2-6 sturdy flip-chart stands - we define "sturdy" as "if you threw it at someone it would probably put them in hospital, rather than just make them laugh at you". Just to be crystal clear, we have included two pictures. One shows the type of easel, and the other is the one to avoid.

 * At least 2 pads of flip-chart paper per stand: 3M brand Post-it styled is preferred
### Catering 
 * Drinking water, plenty of it, should be abundantly available during the session
 * Coffee and tea available continuously
 * Healthy snack offerings as well as indulgent ones
 * Meals served in a room separate from the meeting room
 * A sit-down dinner is okay on the first and even the second evening, but otherwise buffet meals are preferred so that participants can eat quickly and get back to work if they so choose

At the end of the day, what really matters is that the room is large enough with plenty of wall space, and that the venue staff are flexible enough to meet our (ever-changing) needs. Everything else can be sorted out as we go along.
