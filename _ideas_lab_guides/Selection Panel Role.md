The workshop succeeds – or fails – primarily because of the right mix of people in the room: Participants who represent a diverse range of experiences and who are likely to enjoy this intense, interdisciplinary experience.

Choosing the Participants is usually done by Selection Panel early in the planning process, prior to the event. These Panel members are responsible for putting the right people in the room, and that is extremely important.

The selection process varies depending upon the rules governing the event Organizers. Typically, the steps are as follows:
* '**Assemble a Selection Panel.** Often the Selection Panel is comprised of the event's Mentors and the Organizers. Some institutions require a separate Panel. Either way, it’s critical to set the date of the panel early in your planning process, and get the dates in everyone's agendas. This is also key: Panel members need to understand that while they are reviewing potential Participants based on their expertise, they also need to "look at the person behind the science." Knowinnovation workshops require people to be able to play nicely together. Selecting Participants solely on the basis of their technical brilliance may not result in well functioning, resilient teams.
* **Review all the applications.** The Organizers should first remove invalid applications, such as undergraduate students, commercial organizations, and individuals residing outside the sponsoring organization's country (if international applicants are not allowed). It’s important to be clear about entry criteria for acceptance.
* **Distribute the valid applications to the Panel members.** Ideally, every application should be reviewed by all the Panel members. But if there are a huge number of applications, it may be necessary to divide them among the Panelists. In this case, be sure to have each application reviewed by at least two Panel members.
* **Create a spreadsheet.** Prior to the selection meeting, ask the Panel members to submit their assessments on a spreadsheet. We recommend using Google Sheets, so that a single copy can be managed centrally. We suggest this simple 4 point rating system:
  * ***4 HIGHLY PROMISING*** – has all the desired participant qualities: a) an innovative bent, b) theme-relevant expertise, and c) positive personal attributes; should bring special value
  * ***3 PROMISING*** – is strong on two of the three areas with an allowable weakness in the third, or shows good promise overall even if a little lackluster in some areas
  * ***2 MIXED VALUE*** – a mixed profile but not without the odd sign of promise
  * ***1 UNSUITED*** – a thin or an un-compelling application, or better suited to the conventional individual-bid funding route; too much at an early or late career stage; self-promotion, showcasing, or a pre-agenda as their primary motive
* **Sort the applications by total ranking.** Once the spreadsheet is completed (or the individual sheets combined), the candidates are sorted by total ranking. Candidates whom everyone has rated as unsuitable may be excluded from further discussion, though Panel members may choose to discuss each person and to highlight why they were regarded as unsuitable. This can be useful, if time permits, as it allows everyone to develop a shared understanding of each other's benchmarks.
* **Review and discuss the top picks.** Panelists continue through the list until enough candidates have been identified and a suitable pool of alternates has been created. While reviewing candidates, there will be disagreement between Panel members. The chair of the meeting should establish clear criterion for “possibles.” For instance, is it sufficient to have a majority in favor of a candidate, or would it require unanimity after discussion? It is likely that these rules will be flexed during the review, particularly if a Panel member has particular knowledge of an individual candidate.

Once the selection has been made, the successful applicants should be informed and given a relatively short deadline to respond, in order to invite applicants from the alternate pool if necessary. Unsuccessful candidates are informed of the decision.

**Things to consider:**
 * How will you deal with conflict of interest? Does your organization already have a clear policy, or do you need to develop one?
 * How much lead time do you have to give the applicants? We recommend at least 4 weeks.
 * Will you use an Organizational Psychologist to help you review applications?
