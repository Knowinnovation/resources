 * Coordinating and scheduling planning meetings.
 * Researching and securing a venue for the event.
 * Arranging travel and hotel accommodations for participants.
 * Working with the KI team to order the proper Equipment and Supplies
 * Collecting the materials for the hub group.
 * Communicating with applicants during the application review and invitation process.
