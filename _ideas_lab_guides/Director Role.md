The Director acts as the leader of the event. S/he is appointed by the organizers, and serves to guide the process from a scientific content perspective. The Director sets the stage, clarifying the vision up front and steering the event to stay aligned with that vision over the course of the event.

The attributes of a good workshop Director include:
 * Intellectual standing
 * Expertise related to the workshop topic
 * Credibility and contacts to attract good mentors and stakeholders
 * Impartiality and objectivity
 * Strong interpersonal skills
 * Ability to be a peer reviewer, mentor/subject guide, and leader all at once
 * Enthusiastic about the workshop process and new science, and willing and able to communicate that enthusiasm
 * Low ego
 * Capacity to tolerate ambiguity and to let the workshop process unfold
 * Willingness to collaborate with the facilitation team
 * Prepared to promote the event externally, to academia and industry, the press and media, and the public

The Director needs to be credible to the participants, but not necessarily an expert in the exact topic of the event. S/he needs to instill a sense of ambition in the participants and be an enthusiastic supporter of the process. There will be difficult times during the workshop where the Director has to keep pushing for novel, exciting science. As well, s/he needs to be able to manage a disparate group of mentors, and to model the type of behavior that supports creative thinking.

During the workshop, the Director works closely with the team of mentors, setting the tone as they interact with participants. After the event the Director remains engaged, reviewing final proposals and monitoring the development of the projects.
