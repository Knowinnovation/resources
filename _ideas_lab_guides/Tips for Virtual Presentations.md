title: Tips for Virtual Presentations
---
Like any good presentation, you probably strive to convey your message in a succinct yet engaging manner. This can be particularly difficult for online presentations where time is difficult to track and audience cues are often impossible to gauge.  We realize your presentation is center stage and will occupy the majority of your preparation time so we have prepared a few tips to consider for creating the environment for your talk. 

 * Present from a quiet spot. If you are presenting from your office, be sure to silence your incoming emails, mute your phone and maybe leave a note on your door. 
 * Remember you are being watched so if you are part of a panel and not speaking, you are probably still visible. It might not be the best time to grade papers, practice yoga or eat your lunch. 
 * You might also want to check your camera angle before show time. Participants are probably far more interested in looking at you instead of your ceiling (unless you have a cool ceiling of course). 
 * Login early. We recommend at least 15 minutes but check with your KI representative. We are always happy to have tech checks prior to the day of the event. This may be particularly useful if you have slides you would like to present or the platform is new to you.
