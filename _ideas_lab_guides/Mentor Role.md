The Mentors are similar to “peer reviewers” but with a much more creative role: to connect and catalyze. They have a potential role in selecting the participants before the event begins, and commenting on the research projects that emerge from the workshop, with the overall aim to ensure that the event leads to high-quality innovative research.

The Mentor team should be diverse group, providing expertise on various dimensions of the problem. At the start of the event, their job is to encourage new ideas by asking questions, highlighting ideas that seem exciting, and making connections between participants and to the wider body of knowledge. 

The Mentor role changes towards the end of the event, when they are often asked to adopt a more critical perspective in order for them to be able to assist in the funding recommendations. Mentors work to provide objective advice and input to the participants. 

You were chosen because you have the following characteristics:
 * Intellectual standing
 * Knowledge of some aspect(s) of the subject area
 * Impartiality and objectivity
 * Interpersonal skills
 * Capacity to instruct and guide by asking provoking questions
 * Ability to act as a peer reviewer and a subject guide
 * Enthusiasm for the workshop topic and the event
 * Willingness to collaborate with a facilitation team
 * General desire to see the participants succeed in coming up with novel proposals

Mentors need to have credibility with the participants. They should represent a range of different academic perspectives, be curious and ambitious about the science, and be very good at connecting and catalyzing. This is also critical: they have to stay neutral and avoid getting too involved in any of the ideas.
