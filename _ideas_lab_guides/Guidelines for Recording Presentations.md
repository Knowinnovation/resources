Hello,

The purpose of this email is to explain:
 * the design of the <<event>>, and how your session will work;
 * how you can record and upload your presentation;
 * what we need you to do in the short term.

The event has been redesigned so that almost all of the live presentations will now be pre-recorded, and made available to participants in advance of the event. This means that you can now use your time to focus on discussions with, and between, the participants. In the interests of simplicity, we have created a default structure for all of the sessions. The structure is outlined below. However, you are welcome to design your session in whatever way makes most sense for your topic, so please don’t feel constrained by the default design. 

Default concurrent session design:
 * five minutes for you to set the scene, and suggest questions/provocations for your participants to discuss;
 * place the participants into virtual table groups, 5-6 people per group. These table groups typically talk for 20-30 minutes during which time they discuss the questions you raised in your presentation. The table groups will be able to capture their questions/ideas on electronic sticky-notes, and you will be able to see their notes as they type them;
 * finally, you will have up to 25 minutes for a Q&A/wrap up session, during which you can address any issues that you want to highlight.

If you feel your session is likely to diverge from this basic structure, please let me know and we can arrange a time to discuss the options.

'''Recording your presentation'''

Although you are welcome to record a ‘straight to smartphone camera’ presentation without slides, we expect most presenters will want to record their slides with a voice over. 
 * In case you haven’t used this feature before, Microsoft provides a good walk through for PowerPoint on this webpage [support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0B9502C6-5F6C-40AE-B1E7-E47D8741161C#OfficeVersion=Office_365). 
 * Apple provide a similar feature for Keynote. Their instructions can be found here: [support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keynote/tan8a5df9cc5/mac)
 * Finally, if you would prefer to include a video of yourself, along with the slides, we recommend that you use Zoom’s Screen Share feature combined with local recording. The instructions can be found here: [support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

Once you have recorded your presentation, please:
 * Save it with a filename that includes your name, e.g. “session title your name.mp4”
 * Upload the presentation to our server using this link:
