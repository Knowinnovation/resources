1. Install the Zoom client. You can download the software for your computer (or smartphone) [from here](https://zoom.us/support/download)
1.  Check that your speakers, or headphones are set to the right level. Please note, we recommend using headphones, because it will reduce feedback. iPhone-style earbuds are perfectly good for this purpose.

1.  If you decide to use a telephone to join the audio part of the meeting, i.e. you are using your computer, and your telephone. Please follow [these instructions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362663-Joining-a-Meeting-by-Phone) to link your telephone number to your meeting name.
