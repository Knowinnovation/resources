Hello,

We are rapidly approaching the start of our Ideas Lab. In preparation for the event, we would like to invite you to drink some coffee, and have some interesting conversations. More specifically, we would like you to take part in a Randomized Coffee Trial.

A Randomized Coffee Trial (RCT), is a slightly tongue-in-cheek way of describing informal meetings between people who don’t usually get to spend time together. The idea originated at [NESTA](https://www.nesta.org.uk), and has become popular around the world. The [original version](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/institutionalising-serendipity-via-productive-coffee-breaks/) of the RCT simply matched people, randomly, and invited them to meet, have coffee, and talk about whatever they found interesting. Although this proved to be very enjoyable, we have found that adding a little more structure to the event, can make the results even more useful.

Here is what we are inviting you to do:
 * Add your name to the Randomized Coffee Trial page, which you can find here  - please do this by Friday.
 * We will pair you up with a participant who has a very different area of expertise.
 * Once you are partnered up, you arrange a mutually convenient time for a virtual meeting, typically for about 30-45 minutes
 * Once you have got to know each other, we would like you to answer the question “If we had to do a research project together, what would be the most interesting questions - related to -topic -  we could work on?”. For the purposes of this activity, please don’t feel constrained by resources or even the current state of scientific knowledge. We want to know what intriguing questions lie at the intersection of your disciplines, and experience.
 * Finally, we need you to tell us your top three questions - you will be able to enter those directly into Kistorm - it is very simple, and all you need to do is to provide enough of a description so that everyone can get the essence of your question. We will use the questions at the Ideas Lab

Some Q&A for the curious
 * Can we meet in person, or does it have to be virtual? If it is convenient for you to meet face to face, please go right ahead. However, if you are a long way apart, then Zoom, Facetime, or just a phone call are fine too.
 * Does it have to involve coffee? No, there doesn’t appear to be a strong relationship between caffeine and creativity, so other drinks are equally acceptable.
 * If I enjoy the experience, can I do another one? Yes, we would be delighted to arrange other RCT meetings
