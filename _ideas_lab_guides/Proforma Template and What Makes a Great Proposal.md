Before beginning the process of designing the agenda, it’s important to understand the final output that participants will be asked to produce at the workshop. This usually consists of a short presentation and 2-page summary of their project proposals (see template below). During  the agenda designing process, it is helpful to have the Organizing Committee review and customize this template. The Organizing Committee should also identify the key criteria that will be used to assess the quality of each section of the template. Below is a sample of a template that may be provided to participants.

__Proforma: < event title >__

 * Title of project
 * Investigators
  * Who are the group members? 
  * Which institutions do they represent? 
  * Who is the group leader / PI?
 * Introduction
  * What is the relevant problem being addressed? 
  * What is the challenge (methods, models & approaches) faced while addressing the problem? 
  * What is the relevance of the project?
 * Approach
  * What is the current state of the art? (What are the current assumptions in the structure?)
  * Why is the current state of the art not adequate for this problem? 
  * What do you hope to achieve and how will you do it?
 * Innovation
  * Why is your approach potentially transformative? 
  * How is the project innovative (development of new methods or significant adaptation of existing methods)?
 * Significance
  * Why is this work important?
  * What is the grander vision?
  * What are the broader impacts? 
 * Environment
  * What are the team members’ areas of expertise?
  * What are the specific roles/contributions of each group member? 
  * Does the team have all the necessary expertise / skills to carry out this project? If not, what’s missing?
  * Where is the transdisciplinarity?
  * What resources are available?
  * What data is associated / available?
  * How will you access the data you need in the appropriate timeframe?
 * Timeline
  * Define a 3 year timeline for your project.

=== What makes a Great Proposal? ===

The definition of "success" varies for each event. In some cases the primary criterion is simply to get disparate communities to engage with each other. Other events focus on encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations between early stage researchers. In this case, the main role of the scientific question is to act as a raison d'etre, or primary reason, to foster new partnerships, with hope of important outcomes at some later date.

But for most KI workshops, success is judged by the novelty, and potential, of the research proposals. Our rule-of-thumb is that a KI workshop should produce outcomes that no one could have predicted. Given this general guideline, the following criteria are often used to help participants understand what is required, and we encourage you to keep them in mind:
 * An exciting idea, with obvious novelty and eureka potential
 * A compelling proposal with a serious WOW factor
 * High quality science
 * A interdisciplinary project and team
 * A team that is greater than the sum of its parts
 * Evidence that you have the right people on the team to tackle the research
 * Evidence that team experience is well utilized
 * Budget and costs are sufficient, but justifiable
 * Clear demonstration about how the output might have impact
