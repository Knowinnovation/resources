## Selecting the Participants 

For a KI workshop, there are two ways to recruit participants: through a call for Expression of Interest (!EoI) or by inviting participants directly. The former is much more common. Usually, an open process involving a call for Expressions of Interest is used to solicit participation. This can be circulated to various scientific communities that have an obvious connection to the question or problem that the workshop will address. The !EoI encourages a more natural diversity than handpicking participants, based on the reach of the call for applications.

In order for a KI workshop to be successful, participants should come from a ''range'' of disciplines, including the arts, humanities, social sciences, and mathematics - not just the sciences immediately related to the question at hand. We’ll encourage you to think of atypical channels to send the call for !EoIs, so you can extend the perspective of the potential participant roster.

Depending on the funding organization, the call is published three to six months prior to date of the event, with an application window of 30 - 90 days for participants to respond by filling out the !EoI form and returning it for review.

Once the applications are assembled, there might be an initial screening to remove any absolutely unwarranted applications. The body of potential applicants is then shared with our Organizational Psychologist, who reviews the applications prior to a sift meeting, usually a long conference call, with the event director and the mentor team.

It’s important to underscore that the psychologist’s assessment is not a yes/no decision, but rather a recommendation about which candidates are most likely to thrive in a KI workshop setting.

### The Ideal Participant Pool 

Here’s how we counsel our clients to organize a group for one of these events:

**How many?**

Ideally there are 25-35 people in the room. A 40-person event is doable, but it’s probably too much. It makes for a lot of herding people around. When the groups eventually form, there will be a lot of them, making the report-backs and presentations a bit tedious; the audience can get fatigued and the feedback won’t be as constructive.

**Situated around the Problem**

Each participant needs to have some connection with the problem area; their expertise has to be relevant to the challenge at hand. They might only understand or have experience with one small aspect of the problem, and that's okay. They don't need to understand all aspects of the problem, but at least some part of it. Or they need to have some expertise that would be useful if applied to understanding or solving the problem.

**Multidisciplinary**

We need to have "as much diversity as we can afford," to quote [Michael Kirton](http://books.google.fr/books/about/Adaption_Innovation.html?id=FVsqmQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y), yet we don't want to have more than we need from any single discipline. That means there might be three or four people from several key disciplines – those with the most obvious impact on the challenge at hand – as they will be the key members of any project team that forms. There might be two participants from several other disciplines slightly removed from the question. And then several outliers: for instance an artist or illustrator, a designer, an architect, or someone from a totally different field of study or practice whose experience can be related, in some way, to the central problem.

One example of this is an Ideas Lab we facilitated on the subject of enhancing and improving upon Photosynthesis. As would be expected, there were biologists, biochemists, and plant scientists in the group. But there were also two physicists, who helped to draw people’s thinking outside the norm. They asked questions that helped to test assumptions, and proposed analogous theories from their domain that helped the scientists “closer” to the question look at it differently.

**Stakeholder Relevance**

In a stakeholder driven event, it’s important to include the voice of the customer. Can we identify who some of the customers or constituents might be? Will we have potential entrepreneurs, politicians, etc? While we want the research ideas to be very novel, even close to impossible – we also want the outcome to be meaningful to the target user or beneficiary. 

**Young Mindsets**

The workshop participants need to have a certain amount of elasticity in their thinking, and it helps to have an intellectual appetite. Young academics (and entrepreneurs) are ideal, and seasoned thinkers are good, too, as long as they have the capacity to keep their minds open and their egos in check. Senior academics can add a great depth of knowledge and experience to the group, and if they are willing to collaborate and share knowledge without dominating, their contributions are very important. We look for open-minded thinkers who are enthused by the mix of ideas that come up in discussions with people of different types and levels of experience.

**Empathy over Eminence**

If we do need to recruit more senior academics, we look for those who can demonstrate the ability to "bring on" younger researchers. These are generally scientists who've had lab team members go on to form their own labs. We're looking for senior academics who are good at working in a more Socratic way, for whom it's natural to help develop, rather than direct, the thinking of their younger associates.

**Avoid Big Egos**

The watch-out is for high profile academics with long lists of articles and credentials and egos to match. They get invited be cause they’ll lend credibility to the event, or because the organizers might fear a backlash if they aren’t included. Everybody comes to a KI workshop with a potential idea in their back pocket, but most participants encounter new and more intriguing ideas during the first two days and drop their original ideas fairly quickly. The heavy-hitters may hold on to their own ideas too fiercely, pushing them into the mix or trying to round up a group around their pet project while taking a very directive role. Their group then ceases to be collaborative; younger academics who are attracted to the star power fall into lower status roles which limits the extent of their contribution.

Very often these projects don’t get funded because they lack the spark of those generated from new minds colliding in the fold of the energy of the workshop, or because the mentor team recognizes the project as just another iteration of the senior academic’s work. Then the senior academic gets angry and the younger ones stand beside him, bewildered, thinking they’d attached themselves to a sure bet. It’s a shame because if they hadn’t rallied around the big name, their own thinking would have probably have extended further and in many different, more interesting directions.

Not all senior academics are domineering, and many are very happy to sit at a table with other participants with varying levels of knowledge and experience. But if the egos are too large - junior or senior - they will inhibit the collaborative thinking that is the trademark of a KI workshop.

**Diversity**

We know that a KI workshop is typically multidisciplinary. However, it is also important that each workshop represent diversity beyond differing fields of expertise. When possible and applicable, we encourage keeping the following diversities in mind when selecting participants:
* gender
* race
* sexual orientation
* culture
* disability
* career stage
* institution size

**Different and Unknown**

Our workshops are founded on the premise that if you are looking for a different result – i.e. interdisciplinary projects with a high degree of novelty – then you have to do something different from the normal channels used to generate research projects. Already a KI workshop is different because of the process that individuals go through to get to new ideas for research projects. But the best results come when the people in the room are different than the usual suspects normally consulted. Ideally the participants don’t know each other. They might know of each other, but the most creative output comes when people are meeting up for the first time on the on-line network just a few weeks before the event, and in person for the first time when they walk into the workshop meeting room.
