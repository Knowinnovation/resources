The best way to be sure that the participants can get a full grasp of the context of the challenge is to invite people to address the group who have real experience with the issue, like experts in fields related to the workshop topic from government, industry, lobbyists, or citizen/user groups. In some cases, depending on the nature of the workshop, Stakeholders can be mentors or even funders. In other cases, Stakeholders are invited to spend one day at the workshop to make a presentation to the group and to be available to answer questions.

The role of the Stakeholder is to provoke the thinking of the participants by helping them to deeply understand the nature of (usually a piece of) the problem, to share with them the current thinking on the challenge and the current research available, or to challenge them to think of possible solutions or to test their assumptions about what might be possible. The role of the Stakeholder, when presenting to the group, is not to persuade them to see things his or her way, but to provoke the participants to ask different kinds of questions about how the might approach the problem.
