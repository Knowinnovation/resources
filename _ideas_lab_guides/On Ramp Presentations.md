An on-ramp presentation has two purposes:
* To provide non-experts with an introduction to a particular perspective on a problem
* To provide the organisers with input on how the audience sees the problem.
In order to achieve the objectives, it is usually necessary to run a series of on-ramp presentations. Each presentation provides a different perspective on the problem, and therefore appeals to a different group of faculty.  At a practical level, we would usually expect to run these presentations in different physical locations, i.e. we bring the presentations to the faculty in their home locations.

Our general advice for these sessions is:
* Run lunchtime events
* Keep the overall length to under an hour, with the presentations being 20-30 minutes
* Pitch the content at the level of 1st year graduate students. In other words, aim at non-expert, but well educated.
* Ideally, have more than one presenter. This could allow for more than one perspective to be shared, or offer a point and counterpoint model. Both work well
* Aim to provide the audience with a good overview of the big challenge.
* Leave time for the participants to ask questions, and make sure to capture how they see the problem. What are the aspects which they find most interesting?
