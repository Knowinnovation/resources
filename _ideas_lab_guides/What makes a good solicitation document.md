### Overview

In order to recruit a diverse range of participants it is necessary to develop a solicitation document that appeals to a broad community, whilst also highlighting why the problem is important. 

We have included links to a number of documents which we felt were very effective.  We hope the examples will stimulate your thinking, but they should be regarded as suggestions rather than models to copy.

When thinking about your document, we have found it important to consider:
* Is the core question clear and compelling? Does it talk about an ambitious vision of the desired future state? It is well worth testing this with potential participants from across the range of disciplines you are hoping to recruit from?
* Does the question really merit an intensive, innovative workshop, or are there good enough solutions that haven't been implemented? If there are good solutions, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't hold a workshop of some kind, but it will change the nature of the event. For instance, instead of focusing on innovation, you may need to concentrate on developing consensus, and action plans.
* Does your document address why the current thinking/solutions are unsatisfactory? It can be helpful to explain just how big the gap is between current best practices and the desired future state.
* Finally, please make sure that the solicitation doesn't actually define ''how'' the problem needs to be solved. Although it can be very tempting to offer this sort of guidance, it can also constrain participants' ideas, which is unhelpful at this stage.
