= An Overview of the Workshop Process and Roles =
=== Introduction ===
This document explains the key roles within a Knowinnovation (KI) workshop, and outlines the main tasks and responsibilities. These workshops, by their nature, are very flexible events. This document should therefore not be regarded as prescriptive, but rather as a starting point for a conversation about the roles and responsibilities at the workshop.

=== Roles within a KI Workshop ===
A KI workshop will typically have somewhere between 30 and 50 people. This number breaks down into several distinct groups. Not all groups will be present at any particular event.
=== Project Administrator ===
Leading up to the event, having someone - often a member of the Organizing team - focused on administration and logistics is invaluable. When an event runs smoothly at an ideal venue, everyone is able to focus on novel science and making new connections. The Project Administrator’s role includes:
 * Coordinating and scheduling planning meetings
 * Researching and securing a venue for the event
 * Arranging travel and hotel accommodations for participants
 * Working with the Knowinnovation team to order the proper equipment and supplies
 * Collecting the materials for an online community around the event
 * Communicating with applicants during the application review and invitation process

=== Director ===
The Director is responsible for shaping the event. S/he brings the vision of what the event should address. In addition, the Director also plays a key role in identifying and recruiting the Mentors. The individual could come from academic, governmental, or business sectors. It isn’t essential that the Director is an expert in the core of the challenge, but s/he is usually expected to be deeply immersed in a dimension of the problem.
==== Key characteristics ====
The Director has to have:
 * Respect within the community
 * A broad understanding of, and enthusiasm for, the topic
 * Impartiality and objectivity
 * Appropriate national and international  contacts relevant to the topic
 * The ability and willingness to persuade people to take part as mentors or stakeholders
==== Key duties ====
The Director has the following responsibilities:
===== Before the event =====
 * Finalizing the definition of the topic (within the first month)
 * Identifying suitable impartial individuals to act as Mentors (within the first month)
 * Working with Facilitators to plan the process and timetable for the event (while the call for Participants is out)
 * Working with the Organizers to brief the Mentors on their role
 * Working with the panel of Mentors and the Organizational Psychologist (if used) to select appropriate Participants (immediately after the closing date)
===== At the event =====
 * Leading and participating in the event itself
===== After the event =====
 * Reviewing the research proposals
 * Taking part in monitoring progress or networking meetings involving the projects (as appropriate and time allowing)
=== Mentors ===
The Mentors are similar to peer subject guides. They work with the Director to provide objective advice and input to the Participants, but they also play an active role in encouraging ambitious, interdisciplinary thinking. Furthermore, they are often involved in selecting the Participants and in commenting on the research projects arising from the event, with the overall aim to ensure that the event leads to high-quality innovative research.
==== Key characteristics ====
Mentors need many of the same characteristics as the Director:
 * Intellectual standing
 * Impartiality and objectivity
 * A broad understanding of and enthusiasm for the event topic
==== Key duties ====
The Mentor responsibilities are:
===== Before the event =====
 * Populating the online community with engaging and thought-provoking discussions and questions
===== At the event =====
 * Guiding Participant thinking and output
===== After the event =====
 * Reviewing the outputs of the event (research proposals)
 * Giving feedback to the Organizers
 * Taking part in monitoring progress or networking meetings involving the event projects, as appropriate and time allowing

At the event, the Director and Mentors are influential in setting the tone for the event. They are involved in two main activities: connecting and catalyzing.  They connect Participants with each other - when they hear similar conversations occurring within different groups. They also catalyze new thinking by asking probing questions, which help Participants to think about the problems in new and interesting ways. 

Typically, a team of four or five Mentors is suggested. They could be academics or representatives of stakeholder organizations. As a rule, Mentors are not eligible to submit research proposals.
=== Provocateurs ===
The Provocateurs, or speakers, at an event will vary depending on the event topic. Usually, a 5-day workshop will only have one or two speakers. The main goal of the Provocateurs is to drive the Participants toward more novel and innovative thinking and conversation. Speakers can be representatives from industries, governments, charities, local citizen groups, etc., and usually fall under one of the following categories:
 * Stakeholders, individuals who can present a “user” perspective to the workshop
 * Provocateurs, experts who pose outlier perspectives on the subject, which hopefully disrupts Participants’ mindsets or perspectives
  * +10 Speakers, Provocateurs who help the Participants stretch their thinking by presenting imaginary views of the future
Speakers are important additions to an event and may contribute by:
 * Giving challenging/provocative presentations about the current state of play, the problems being discussed at the event, and the political/social context
 * Taking full part in the event discussions as ideas are generated, giving a ‘user’ perspective
 * Collaborating on projects funded as a result of the event
Experience has shown that having speakers present for the whole event is beneficial. It is also important that any representatives of stakeholder organizations have the right seniority and attitude – having positive input from them can be really helpful, while negative or critical comments can be demoralizing for Participants.
=== Organizational  Psychologist ===
We have found the involvement of someone with expertise in assessing people’s characters and behaviors can be extremely helpful when choosing Participants, particularly as we are trying to choose people with the appropriate characteristics, not only the appropriate technical expertise, for a KI workshop. Because the Director and Mentors may well be more used to the normal peer review selection procedures, it is worth considering involving a psychologist in the Participant selection meeting, with the agreement of the Director.
=== Selection Panel ===
The Selection Panel has one job prior to the event: sifting through the applications and selecting appropriate Participants for the workshop. The Selection Panel works with the Director, Organizing Committee, and Organizational Psychologist (if used) to select participants. This role is sometimes filled by some or all of the Mentor team.
=== Facilitators ===
While the Director and Mentors are responsible for the content of the event, the Facilitators are responsible for the process, specifically designing and scheduling the various activities and sessions of the event (e.g. ice-breakers, techniques for generating ideas, break-out groups, creative exercises, feedback sessions, etc.). They work closely and collaboratively with the Director and the Organizers when designing the schedule. At the event itself, they will take the lead on explaining the process and directing the activities. 
=== Participants ===
The Participants will have been selected from those applying to attend the workshop. They should therefore have an interest in the topic, and the right attitude to the event approach. They should demonstrate a desire to work at the edge of their disciplines and be comfortable with the ambiguity often associated with interdisciplinary research.
