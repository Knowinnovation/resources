layout: default
---
If the focus of the event is on early career researchers, it can be helpful to remind the panelists about he selection criteria. A suggested email is shown below.

Panel members please note before commencing review. Look for suitability in terms of how best the applicant is aligned to the objectives of the event as laid out in this one page Guide . With the focus at this event on early career applicants you should look for promising signals for potential, flexibility, an up-for-it collective spirit and an imaginative bent as detailed in the Guide. While perhaps being less exacting with early-careers than when assessing middle and senior stage career applicants, you should yet aim to rate the applicant pool along the 1 to 4 scale as outlined in the Guide, while watching against central tendency and unconscious bias. Remember also to have to hand a brief sentence or two of notes to back up your score to help progress the selection decisions meeting scheduled for xx/yy. We will have an organizational psychologist - who delivers as a sandpit suitability specialist - also scoring the applicants.
