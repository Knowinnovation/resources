Mentors are similar to "peer reviewers" with more of a guidance role. They work to provide objective advice and input to the participants at the workshop, with the overall aim to ensure that the workshop leads to high-quality innovative research.

At the workshop, the Mentors are influential in setting the tone for the event. In particular, they should make every effort to promote a free-thinking climate and take care not to dominate nor let anyone else dominate the discussions. For example, "It won’t work" or "We've been there before, this is nothing new" types of interjections may well discourage the creative flow required in the initial stages of the workshop.

A team of four or five mentors is preferred. They could be academics or representatives of stakeholder organizations. They are generally not eligible for the research funding arising from the workshop. However, all travel and subsistence costs will be reimbursed.

Characteristics that are helpful include:
* Intellectual standing in the relevant area
* Impartiality and objectivity
* Enthusiasm for the topic
* An encouraging personali_y

**Responsibilities before the workshop include**:
* Collaborating with the Organizing Team and Facilitators to help prepare for the event
* Providing thought-provoking discussions and resources for the participants virtually, via an online group page

**Responsibilities at the workshop**:
* Getting to know the participants, and helping them connect with one another
* To the degree possible, helping participants understand the state of the art of their respective fields
* Providing constructive feedback on participants’ ideas

**Responsibilities after the workshop (or on the last day)**:
* Reviewing the outputs of the workshop and providing recommendations to the funders as requested
