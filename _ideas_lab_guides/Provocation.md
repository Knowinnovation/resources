**Provocation (n.)**

1. *the act of provoking.*
2. *something that provokes, esp. by inciting, instigating, inspiring, angering, or irritating.*

A main objective of an Ideas Lab is to inspire participants to redefine the challenge they’re tackling and to see it from a different perspective that might unlock new approaches. Collecting people from diverse disciplines and asking them to talk with each other is the first step to shifting perspective on a challenge. The next step is to give them something new to talk about, to lead to thought-provoking discussions. Depending on the nature of the event, it can be useful to have a speaker (or an activity) that has little to do with the problem but offers the opportunity for participants to draw analogies or to make connections that might stimulate their thinking. We want to make participants a little bit uncomfortable by giving them knowledge or insights they didn’t have before, that alter how they see the challenge. If “what goes in, comes out” then it makes sense that in order to arrive at new thinking, it helps to introduce new and interesting input.

### Guest Speakers
Speakers are important additions to an event and may contribute by:
 * Giving challenging/provocative presentations about the current state of play, the problems being discussed at the event, and the political/social context
 * Taking full part in the event discussions as ideas are generated, giving a ‘user’ perspective
 * Collaborating on projects funded as a result of the event

We usually ask the speakers to clear their agenda, if possible, to remain with the group for a few hours after their presentation. Then participants can engage them during breaks or meals to ask additional questions or for further discussion.

Live speakers are ideal as Skype and other virtual mechanisms are at the mercy of a good Internet connection. If a very strong speaker cannot be present at the event, best to ask her/him to pre-record a presentation, but then to stand by for live Q&A after the video has played.

#### Provocateurs
Provocateurs are typically present at an event. They are experts who pose outlier perspectives on the subject, which hopefully disrupts participants’ mindsets or perspectives and their role is to deepen participants understanding of a challenge or change how they see it altogether.

#### Plus 10 Talks
The goal of the Plus Talk is to stimulate and provoke the participants’ thinking and, ideally, get them to make new connections outside their normal domains. This means that the speaker doesn’t have to in any way “prove” his or her point, or win the audience over to a particular point of view. Plus 10 talks may happen prior to or as a table discussion on day 1 of an event.

#### On-Ramp Talks
Typically prior to an in-person event, on-ramp presentations have two purposes; to provide non-experts with an introduction to a particular perspective on a problem, and to provide the organizers with input on how the audience sees the problem.

### Excursions
Another way to provoke new thinking is to take a field trip to a specific location that can add a dimension of first-hand knowledge that increases the participants’ understanding of the challenge and their ability to identify questions they wouldn’t have otherwise considered.

### Videos
In some cases, there may be pre-prepared video content, like a TED talk, that relates directly to the challenge at hand and can provoke new thinking. Much like with a live speaker, what’s most important is how the participants react to the content of the video. Any video has to be very well produced and salient – TED talks are good at making sure the speakers are intelligent and competent – but once again it’s critical that the participants be given ample time after the video (minimum 20 minutes) to discuss amongst themselves their reactions and to draw out new questions and ideas that result from the exposure to the video.
