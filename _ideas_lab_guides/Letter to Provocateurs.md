=== Option 1 ===

Thank you for agreeing to be a speaker – or provocateur as we call it – at the upcoming Ideas Lab in (where) on (when).  A few notes and guidelines that might help you prepare your presentation:

1.	Ideas Labs are, by definition, multi-disciplinary.  It’s probably a fair bet that the majority of the audience won't be from your discipline.  Because of that, pitching the talk at the level of “intelligent layperson” seems to work well.

2.	The purpose of the presentation is to stimulate and provoke the audience's thinking, and ideally, get them to make new connections outside their normal domains.  This means that you don't have to in any way “prove” your point, or win the audience over to a particular point of view.  We simply need you to present ideas that might intrigue and provoke an active discussion among the participants.  

3.	Presentations are typically 20 minutes long.  Then, there are 10 minutes for questions of clarification, but no more than that.  We aren't interested in people debating the merits of a particular perspective; we are actually more interested in their reaction to your presentation and to think more about what you’ve shared.  Having said that, if it is possible for you to stay around for lunch, or to linger through the rest of the day, that makes for a great opportunity for the participants to talk with you further and ask you more specific questions privately or in small groups.

We truly appreciate your willingness to contribute to the Ideas Lab process in this way, and we look forward to meeting you.

If you want to learn a bit more about the Ideas Lab methodology, read this post from the KI blog, which gives and overview of the process and explains a bit about how Ideas Labs (a.k.a. Sandpits) got started in the first place.

If you have any questions then please do not hesitate to contact us by email at (insert emails here).  We’ll be facilitating the event and we’ll be on hand to guide you in terms of process, timing and any audio-visual support you’ll require. 

Regards,
